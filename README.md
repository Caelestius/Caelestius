- 👋 Hi, I’m @Caelestius also known as @Fulmen Factor
- 👀 I’m interested in electronics (new like Raspberry Pi and old like cathode ray etc), board games (especially Battletech), reading, hiking outdoors and gaming. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Azure and clouds, also enrolling into the University of applied sciences (Metropolia, Finland), also trying to reinvigorate my C++ knowledge.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any new coding (learning Python and Ruby alongside with Javascript now).
